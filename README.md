# Social

A distributed, decentralized, fully (and actually) serverless social network.

## Features
* Chat, including ability to persist chat session or have ephemeral chat
* Direct peer to peer video calling
* Up to a small number of photos, so it's social, but so it doesn't bog down everyone's bandwidth and storage
* No posts, this is more to facilitate communication and demonstrate browser network

## Factoids

* Data is saved on client computers only, there's literally no server at all. No hand rolled server, no firebase or other "serverless" (heavy quotes) concepts.
* Uses [Browser Network](https://github.com/browser-network) to facilitate this truly serverless architecture.
